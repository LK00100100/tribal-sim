1) You will need to download "node package manager (NPM)" which comes with node.js [(Download)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). In root directory, type the following to install all of the necessary packages. **Do this once.**

```
npm install 
```
2) Open up a terminal and type the following to allow automatic code building whenever code changes:
```
npm run dev
```
3) Open up another terminal and type the following to run a local server:
```
npm run start
```
4) Open up a browser and go here:
```
http://localhost:8888/dist/
```
Note: Whenever you makes changes to your code, save the file, then refresh your browser when ready.
If you want more ideas on how to use Phaser 3, clone the following repo [link](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples), run it locally using:
